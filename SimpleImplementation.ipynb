        "# Open AI Chat Completion API Parameters:\n",
        "\n",
        "## Required parameters:\n",
        "1. **messages**\n",
        "2. **model**\n",
        "\n",
        "## Optional Parameters:\n",
        "1. **max_tokens**:  It specifies the maximum number of tokens allowed to GPT for generating the response. It will stop generating responses after a certain number of tokens. The default value is 4096 tokens. The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length.\n",
        "2. **temperature**: It adjusts the model's level of creativity, from straightforward to imaginative. The default value is 1, it can be set to 0 or 2. Temperature affects the sampling choice of the next predicted tokens. In short, the lower the temperature, the more deterministic the results, meaning the highest probable next token is always chosen. Increasing the temperature could lead to more randomness, encouraging more diverse or creative outputs.\n",
        "3. **top_p**:  top-p or nucleus sampling and temperature serve the same purpose in language models. Top-p sampling selected tokens from the smallest set whose cumulative probability surpasses a given threshold, denoted as ‘p’. Rather than sampling from the entire distribution of possible tokens, top-p sampling focuses on a subset with the highest probabilities. The default value is 1 and setting top-p to 0.1 means only tokens in the top 10% probability range are considered. It is not recommended to use temperature and top-p together.\n",
        "4. **frequency_penalty**: This parameter helps to reduce the repeated sampling of the same set of tokens. It instructs the language model to not use the same words too frequently. The mechanism works by directly adjusting the logits (un-normalized log probabilities) with an additive contribution. The default value is 0, and suitable penalty coefficients typically range from 0.1 to 1. A higher value means the model will be less inclined to reuse the same words, while a lower value implies a greater likelihood of repetitive word usage.\n",
        "5. **presence_penalty**: It can be used to encourage the model to use a diverse range of tokens in the generated text. It instructs the language model to utilize different words, promoting variety in the outputs. A higher presence_penalty value will result in the model being more likely to generate tokens that have not yet been included in the generated text. A higher presence_penalty value will result in the model being more likely to generate tokens that have not yet been included in the generated text.\n",
        "6. **logit_bias**: It acts as a tool to stop the model from generating specific, unwanted tokens or words. By using this parameter, you can control or exclude certain words from GPT’s output. It takes a JSON object that links token IDs to associated bias values ranging from -100 to 100. Essentially, this bias is mathematically added to the logits produced by the model before the sampling process.\n",
        "In short, assigning -100 to a selected token will effectively ban that token from being generated, while assigning 100 will ensure an exclusive selection of that token in the generated output.\n",
        "7. **seed**: seed is still in a beta feature, but it allows you to obtain consistent results for every input submitted to GPT. For instance, if you ask GPT to narrate a story about Pakist'san Political Situation, the generated story may vary each time you ask. However, using the seed will prompt the system to make its best attempt at deterministic sampling, ensuring you get the same result for a given input.\n",
        "8. **function_call(Deprecated)**: This parameter allows you to instruct the language model to perform a specific task before generating an answer to the user’s input. A common example is a weather application where the model lacks current weather data. In such cases, you can gather information from a weather API, incorporate that data into the prompt context, and then instruct the model to generate an answer using that context.\n",
        "9**logprobs**: Its value can be boolean or null. It specifies whether to return the log probabilities of the output token or not. If it is set to True, it will return log probabilities of each output token returned in the content of messages. Its default value is False.\n",
        "10. **top_logprobs**: Its value can be integer or null. An integer between 0 and 20 specifies the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. logprobs must be set to true if this parameter is used.\n",
        "11. **n**: It can be integer or null. How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message?\n",
        "12. **response_format**\n"
